Pass Criteria
All pass criteria for all learning outcomes must be achieved for a pass to be awarded. For example, to meet the LO1 1.4 criterion, the user must be able to interact with the website using javascript. LO2 criterion 2.1 will be a fail if any JavaScript fails the jshint.com validator.

LO1 Design, develop and implement a dynamic front-end web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript

1.1 Design a web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design and presents a structured layout and navigation model, and meets its given purpose

1.2 Design interactivity for a web application that lets the user initiate and control actions, and gives feedback
1.3 Write custom JavaScript, HTML and CSS code to create a responsive front-end web application consisting of one or more HTML pages with significant interactive functionality
1.4 Write JavaScript code to produce relevant responses to user actions
1.5 Implement an interactive web application that incorporates images or graphics of usable resolution, legible, unobscured text, consistent styling, undistracted foregrounds
LO2 Implement front-end interactivity, including user forms, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries and/or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

2.1 Write JavaScript code, that passes through a linter (e.g. Jshint) with no major issues, and write validated HTML and CSS code.
2.2 Write JavaScript functions that correctly implement compound statements such as if conditions and/or loops
2.3 Write code that intelligently handles empty or invalid input data
2.4 Implement appropriate working functionality for all project requirements.
2.5 Organise non-trivial JavaScript code in external file(s) linked to at the bottom of the body element (or bottom of head element if needs to be loaded before the body HTML) and CSS code in external files linked to HTML in the head element
2.6 Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).
2.7 Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
2.8 Write code that does not generate internal errors on the page or in the console as a result of user actions
2.9 Organise code and assets files in directories by file type.
LO3 Test an interactive front-end web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages

3.1 Design and implement manual testing procedures to assess functionality, usability and responsiveness of the web application
3.2 Insert screenshots of the finished project that align to relevant user stories
3.3 Apply test procedures during development, and implementation stages and test to ensure the deployed version matches the development version
3.4 Fully document the results of well-planned manual testing procedures to assess the website’s functionality, usability and responsiveness.
LO4 Deploy an interactive front-end web application to a Cloud platform

4.1 Deploy a final version of the interactive web application code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages)
4.2 Ensure that the deployed application is free of commented out code and has no broken internal links
4.3 Use Git & GitHub for version control of an interactive web application up to deployment
LO5Demonstrate and document the development process through version control system such as GitHub

5.1 Document the full development cycle, with clear evidence given through commit messages, the README.
5.2 Write a README.md file in English for the interactive web application that explains its purpose and the value that it provides to its users.
5.3 Clearly separate and identify code written for the interactive web application and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
5.4 Use consistent and effective markdown formatting, that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors, when writing a README file.
Merit Performance
To evidence performance at Merit level, a learner will, in general, demonstrate characteristics of performance at Merit level as outlined below. The learner must achieve ALL Pass and Merit criteria for merit to be awarded.

1.1 Design a web application following the principles of UX design which meets accessibility guidelines, is easy to navigate and allows the user to find information and resources intuitively
1.2 Design a web application that lets the user initiate and control actions, and gives feedback
1.3 Implement a web application whose purpose is immediately evident to a new user and which provides a good solution to the user’s demands and expectations
2.1 Write code such that users who direct to a non-existent page or resource are redirected back to the main page without having to use browser navigation buttons
4.1 Commit often, for each individual feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small, well-defined and have clear, descriptive messages
5.1 Present a clear rationale for the development of the project, in the README, demonstrating that it has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of, and user stories for a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences).
5.2 Document the UX design work undertaken for this project, including any wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc created as part of the design process, and the reasoning behind it. Include diagrams created as part of the design process and demonstrate that these have been followed through to implementation
5.3 Document testing fully to include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.
5.4 Fully do
