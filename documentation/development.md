# Patrick's Covid19 Tracker

In this document I will attempt explain the process I went trough in thinking, planning and developing this project by utilizing industry standard methodologies.

## UX Design

For this project, I've adopted the methodology of the five planes of UX, which cosist of:

- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton
- Surface Design

> “The Elements of User Experience” book written by Jesse James Garrett, one of the founders of Adaptive Path, a user experience consultancy based in San Francisco.

### Strategy

As the pandemic of Covid19 has changed the way we live, work and interact socially, I wanted to contribute to the world by providing a medium to inform and update people on the seriousness of this virus, while ensuring the that the data is presented in an easy to understand way without any additional clutter or information overload.

### Scope of this Project

- Consume Covid19 related data from a reputable source
- Display this data in an easy to understand and intuitive manner
- Present latest news related to Covid19 pandemic to the user
- User should be able to select display of data between Latest vs Total

### Structure

- As visitors to website may or not be proficient in computer driving, decision was made to organize the website as a single site, seperated by 3 sections:
  - Visual representation of data
  - Comprehensive representation of data
  - Aditional/in-depth representation of data
- A Main navigation bar will be displayed on the top to allow user to navigate to sections and/or select datasets
- A Footer will be displayed in the bottom for aditional information on the project

### Skeleton

wireframes

### Design

---

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
